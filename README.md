# Amadeus Flight Service
The Amadeus flight service is a comprehensive REST API developed in Java 17 using the Spring framework. This project, prepared for the "Amadeus Travel To Future Program" as a case study, serves as a robust solution for managing airport flights, conducting flight searches, and handling user authentication. The core functionality of the service revolves around three main components: Authentication, Airport Management, and Flight Operations. It employs industry-standard JWT token-based authentication via Spring Security, ensuring secure and seamless user interactions with the platform.
